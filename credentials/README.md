# Credentials
This is where you should store *all* credentials you are working with.

All files in this directory will be ignored by `git add`, so they will not be pushed to the repo if they are placed here.

Still make sure you are not accidentally over-riding this feature, by either changing the `.gitignore` or the by using the `-f` flag in `git add`.

Before making commits, you should check `git status` to make sure nothing in this folder has been accidentally added.

There is an example file, do not edit this with real keys, or rename any files to have the same name.

(This file was added using the `-f` flag)
