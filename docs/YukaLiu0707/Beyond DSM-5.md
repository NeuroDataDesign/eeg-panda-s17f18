## Main ideas:
- Although diagnostic labels such as DSM-5 are necessary in clinical practice, they impose limitations on finding potential psychophysiological markers of mental diseases
- Empirical data are being used to construct possible models and guide investigations in psychology and neurobiology
- It is very hard to decide what is the best framework of delineating phenotypic domains
- Data-driven approaches could help in charactering of the unaccounted biological and behavior variations.

## Goals:
- Identify dimensions of phenotypes that accurately represent meaningful variations across multiple domains of behaviors
  - Conducted a bootstrap-based exploratory factor analysis
- Through hybrid hierarchical clustering (HHC) of participants, based on their factor profiles, capture nested hierarchy inside homogenous participants groups
  - Phenotypic characterization by DSM-IV labels and the Achenbach Adult Self-Report (ASR)
- examine multivariate intrinsic brain functional connectivity differences among adjacent clusters and groups of participants

## Methods:
- participants:
  - around 1000 participants of 6-85 years of age
  - part of NKI-RS, a community-based sample

## Results:
- Dimension Reduction
  - a six-factor solution was estimated, accounting for 77.8% of the variance
  - constrained model accounts for 65.4%
- Cluster Analysis
  - 3 cutpoints yield 2,4,8 groups respectively
- Phenotypic Cluster Differences
  - Participants differ from one another with respect to their phenotypic profiles
- Multivariate Intrinsic Connectivity Differences Among Clusters
  - Only MDMR findings from level 1 in phenotypic cluster differences (C1 VS. C2) survived

## Significance to us:
- Supports the validity of data-driven approaches in analysis of neurological and mental disease
- EFA seem to be very useful and could give us some insights
- Factors considered in this paper could also be considered in our project
- Steps in handling of MRI data could be used as a reference
