    "Seed-based Correlation Analysis (SCA) is one of the most common ways to explore functional connectivity within the brain. Based on the time series of a seed voxel (or ROI), connectivity is calculated as the correlation of time series for all other voxels in the brain. The result of SCA is a connectivity map showing Z-scores for each voxel indicating how well its time series correlates with the time series of the seed. Below is an example connectivity map showing correlated voxels based on a seed in the precuneus\n",

    "# Basic simulation\n",
    "If the correlations between p-factor and those structual correlates are reliable, we could perform analysis on them and see if we could notice something that imply high p factor scores. We need more information on what features our data have to further investigate the basic simulation setting.\n",

    "# Possible application in our data\n",
    "P-factor was calculated out using scores extracted from questionnaire (5 for internalizing and externalizing, 3 for thought) through model-fitting (using MPlus). Since we do not have those questionnaires, it would be hard to replicate the \"p-factor\" scores.\n",
    "Another possible approach is that we could look at ROIs that have strong correlations with p-factor score (white matter volume, gray matter and whole-brain intrinsic connectivity)\n"
