## Main ideas:
- When studying pediatric population using techniques such as MRI, problems exist in normalizing pediatric populations to adult reference
- Similar issues also exist in aligning child brains with adult brains: 
  -   misclassification of brain tissue
  -	local and global macrostructural differences between adult and child brains and other factors could make the alignment inaccurate
-	Lack of age-appropriate MRI templates could hamper the study of neurostructual and neurofunctional development
- Creation of a database of age-appropriate MRI reference templates with fine-grained age intervals could propose a possible solution to these issues by providing more precise representations of the brain across lifespan development.
- The database is great for studies of developments in brain structures and functions, since those two brain characteristics are age-sensitive.


## About the database:
- The database was done based on the work of Fonov et al. (2011). Fonov et al. used the National Institutes of Health longitudinal study data (NIHPD).
- The average MRI templates were drawn from a database of over 4,000 participants (obtained from open-access and local sources for whom that have T1-weighted MRIs)
- Creating fine-grained average MRI templates for a wide range of ages with discrete age intervals
- The average MRI templates were drawn from a total database of over 4000 participants from open-access databases or scans performed at the McCausland Center for Brain Imaging (MCBI)
- Average MRI templates created for those ages:
  - ages 2 weeks through 4 years in 1.5-month, 3-month, or 6-month increments
  - for ages 4.5 years to 20 years in 6-month-increments
  - adult reference volumes from 20 years through 89 years in 5-year increments


## Significance to us:
-	We could use these age-appropriate MRI templates instead of standard adult brain MRI template to give more accurate visualization and analysis of the brain with the consideration of age
-	Might also be useful to search for potential development patterns in brain functions and structures
