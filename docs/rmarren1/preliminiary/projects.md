| --------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| Imagined speech EEG-to-text | Create an algorithm which can take as input EEG signal of a subject imagining speech to text of the speech they are imagining (text can be phonemes or words). | Many publications do EEG to speech in a limited sense, e.g. classifying based on a few words, a few phonemes, ect. We can attempt to use NLP techniques to parse entire sentences. | Can definitely re-create other experiments, not guaranteed we will make any progress. May be infeasible due to low SNR <br><br> Okay | Meh datasets (Kara ONE- small, Honey- small and ECoG). <br><br> Okay (might not work, or might not be better than current) <br><br> Okay | All analysis. (Algorithms, machine learning, nautral language processing) <br><br> Okay | EEG experience (Ry + N) (128 channel not 64, preprocessing might need to be modified), some NLP experience (Ry), ML/Stats (all) <br><br> Great |
| Mining Mental Health Biomarkers / Disorder Classification | Mine large datasets for transdiagnostic biomarkers for mental health, and use these to create a classifier which can predict onset or presence of a psychological disorder from EEG data. | Publications which attempt to relate mental health issues with neural signals often have small sample sizes and focus on single disorders, the huge HBN BioBank would allow us to look for transdiagnostic biomarkers and test which previous methods work well for a larger data set. | New and huge dataset, so even if analysis does not go well, scaling up existing methods to big dataset would be interesting <br><br> Great | Amazing dataset (HBN BioBank) <br><br> Great| Mostly analysis, with a decent software engineering / data engineering component to handle many modalities and the data size <br><br> Great| EEG experience, same tasks and data sourece! (Ry + N), ML/Stats (all), SWE/DE (Ry + N + Ro) <br><br> Great| 
| Noninvasive Epileptogenic Zone Location | Create a tool which Neurosurgeons can use to locate Epileptogenic zones in epilepsy patients using EEG/MRI rather than ECoG. Would involve implementing, testing, and improving current algorithms for this task. | Lower the barrier to entry for surgeons who want to use this technique, and make it more effective | Open resource to do this analysis definitely feasible and great thing to exist <br><br> Great | Bad dataset (Epileptic - very small if can't find pre-crash data) <br><br> Bad | Equal parts analysis and software engineering  <br><br> Great| EEG Experience (Ry + N), Stats/ML experience (all) <br><br> Okay|
| 'Kaggle but for brains' | Create an online platform which simplifies data acqisition, preprocessing, ect. and creates a competative space which makes users to use good statistical principles. | Allow many people to test methods on a single dataset (rather than many methods to many datasets), lower barrier of entry for engineers/scientists (especially for amatures / those new to computational neuroscience), reduce time needed for data downloading / data engineering / preprocessing / running algorithms, create a fun competative space. | Very feasible, mostly a software engineering task, but not guaranteed people will use it or find it awesome. <br><br> Okay | Can use any! <br><br> Great| Almost all software engineering / data engineering, perhaps analysis for examples <br><br> Okay| SWE / web dev / DE (all) <br><br> Great |
