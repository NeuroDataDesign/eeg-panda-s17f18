### Data input format
* To work correctly, PySurfer needs to be linked to a "FreeSurfer subjects directory", this is a directory of files formatted to be recognized by the FreeSurfer software package.
* Freesurfer "creates its own file formats for storing and manipulating volumetric, surface and transform data"
* The example plots on the PySurfer website are not reproducible given the data in the repository
