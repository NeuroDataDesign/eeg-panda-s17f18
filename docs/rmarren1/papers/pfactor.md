# The p Factor: One General Psychopathology Factor in the Structure of Psychriatric Disorders?
### Caspi, Houts, Belsky, Goldman-Mellor, ---

##### Main Ideas
* Typically, a Psychiatric nosology is used to classify mental disorders
  * This good for clinical use, put things into bins and treat accordingly.
  * The categorical structure is challanged by high rates of comorbidity.
    * Rule of 50%. (50% of people with 1 have 2, 50% of people with 2 have 3, ect. ect.)
* Scientists note a need for research to go beyong DSM 5
  * What factors underly all psych. disorders?
  * "elucidate the broad, higher-order structure of phenotypic psychopathology
* CFA to examine alternate hypotheses about underlying structure of 10 mental disorders in young adults
* Usually, there is thought to be two main dimensions
  * Internalizing
    * depression, anxiety, panic disorder, social phobia, more common in females
  * Externalizing
    * aggression, alcoholism, antisocial disorders, more common in males
  * Internalizing and Externalizing shown through CFA to be highly correlated.
    * Are they both positively influenced by the same general underlying factor p?
  * This model is usually only used in children
    * brains don't "magically" change at age 18
    * this study shows that this structure present in adults as well
* Shows that there is a third dimension (Thought Disorder) which accounts for
  psychotic disorders
  * This dimension highly correlated with the general p factor
* Transdiagnostic approach!
  * Co-occurance and high corrlation between presence of different DSM categorized
    disorders, along with the fact that many treatments that help people with one
    disorder help people with many others, suggests there may be an underlying
    structure to psychopathological disorders.
* *KEY* Similar to the g-factor of general intelligence.
  * idea that there is a single factor that accounts for general intellectual capability,
    then other factors determine how that general capability is translated into more specialized
  * E.g. a person with high g and high verbal skills may be a lawyer, a person with high g and
    high spatial skills may become an engineer, but g is the ** most predictive ** variable
    of getting one of these successful jobs
  * Psych disorder treatment should follow the following: if there is a new variable X thought to correlate
    with presence of a disorder Y, is the correlation significant accounting for p?

##### Structure of psychopathology
* Internalizing and Externalizing dimension do not fully explain disorders, the
  third dimension Thought Disorder is needed to fully explain
* All three of these dimesions are highly correlated
  * Makes it difficult to see what disorders are caused by which, because many times
    symptoms will co-occur
* After accounting for p in a heirarchical model, Internalizing and Externalizing
  have a negative correlation
  * Makes it easier to see the difference between people
  * e.g. presence for depression or antisocial disorder is most highly predicted
    by your general propensity to get a disorder in the first place.
  * You need to account for this underlying propensity. Once done, the Internalizing
    and Externalizing dimensions will better determine which kind of disorder you get.
    

##### Dataset
* Longitudinal questionares, diagnoses, family reports, teacher reports, ect.
  from n~1000 people from the same town in New Zealand
  * Aged 3 - 38 in study, all in same birth cohort
  * Some died, some drop out, some stop answering
  * Need a better and possibly larger dataset to better generalize these results
* Longitudinal data is a much better way to make statements about psych. disorders
  because these disorders are often episodic and sequential, it is not guaranteed that you
  will catch someone in the time of showing symptoms in a cross-sectional experiment

##### Ideas about our project
* Article says reliable measures for p still need to be developed
  * HBNB dataset seems perfect for this (at least in kids)
  * However, HBNB is cross sectional
* There are probably better statistical methods to do the experiments in this article
  * Anything better than CFA?
* Believed that the p factor has neurological or genetic roots.
  * Can mine for genetic or neurological biomarkers in the HBNB dataset
  * Multi-modal analysis, probably easier to regress high dim data to one variable p
* Visualizations on phenotypic data should account for p (normalize by p),
  more interesting results will probably come out of this
