- High-functioning autistic participants and the controls show the same cortical area activations to similar degree in fMRI
- Literature suggests neural basis of alterted cognition in autism entais a lower degree of integration of information across certain cortical areas resulting from reduced intracortical connectivity
- The functional connecivity was computed in the following steps:
  - ROIs were paired
  - for each pair of ROIs, compute the average time course of all the activated voxels
  - compute correlation between the average time course
- Correlation was computed only on imagings belonging to the experumental condition
- Connectivity measures were further divided in 2 ways in the analyses of variance:
  - frontal-parietal connections or other possible connections
  - intrahemispheric, interhemispheric or other possible connections
- An exploratory factor analysis was then performed for each group of ROIs
  - each factor could relate to a larger network of brain regions that involve high-level function
  - Factor loadings represent the degree to which each of the ROIs correlates with each of the factors
  
*Significance to us:*

For diseases such as Autism, simply looking at activated areas in brain shown by fMRI someties does not give much information. It is not very intuitive to get information about how communications inside brain work by looking at areas activated directly. A measurement of connectivity, or exploration of underconnectivity could provide researchers with ideas of how well information is integrated inside brain other than whether it is received or not. We could also explore correlations that exist among ROIs to investigate how brain regions might relate to each other when activated.


# Search of potential biomarkers

*Significance to us:*

With a list of possible biomarkers taken from literature (in EEG: P300, P50 and ERP components), researchers would be able to find out whether a potential biomarker exist in there dataset or not, allowing accerleration of identification and a more directly assay of the effects of disorder risk variants.

**Background research on biomarkers relates to p-factor**

p-factor, on the other hand, has been shown to have correlations with several structual correlates, and could contribute to broad risk for common forms of mental illness.
