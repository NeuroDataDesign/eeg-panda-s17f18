    "# Importance\n",
    "- Diagnoses based on evalution of behavior and clinical phenotypes has led to somewhat arbitrary cut-offs for disorder and subtype classifications\n",
    "- Non-invasive biomarker research in psychiatry has focused largely on neuroimaging as a tool for identifying neural functions that are meaningfully associated with psychopathology\n",
    "- heterogeneity exists within disovers both at the levels of genetic and environmental risk factors in brain systems\n",
    "     - Large samples will enable improved understanding and better stratification of the brain functions that underlie disorder phenotypes and their proposed subtypes\n",
    "\n",
    "The five candidate domains of RDoc are (1) Negative and Positive Valence Systems, (2) Cognitive Systems, (3) Systems for Social Processes and (4) Arousal and (5) Regulatory Processes. These domains and circuits transcend DSM diagnoses to attain further connection between biological abnormalities and symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "As major advances in computer hardware and signal processing greatly increased the amount of spatially and temporally precise information about brain function that can be extracted from EEG data, EEG has become a good neuroimaging technique for search of biomarkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERP attempts to reduce the complexity of the recorded EEG by \n",
    "- averaging across epochs time-locked to sets of events assumed to elicit similar brain function\n",
    "- comparing at most a few resulting channel ERP features to behavioral differences across groups, conditions, and/or treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good approach to identify coherent ERP features with signal-to-noise ratio adequate for stably comparing group, task, and/or treatment conditions. However, there is also a great reduction in the amount of infotmation about brain function extracted from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Indepedent Component Analysis (ICA)\n",
    "- ICA decomposition can be used to identify distinct cortical source activities that are sensitive and specific to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders\n",
    "- essentially they learn, from the data itself, spatial filters that separate the EEG data into a sum of component processes with maximally distinct or independent time courses\n",
    "    - improved understanding of a wide variety of functions in the general population, including face processing, cognitive control and mirror neuron activity\n",
    "    - has the potential to provide objective markers and phenotypes of the degree of affective and emotional abnormality in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression\n",
    "- ICA is able to do the seprations without priori knowledge of individual properties or locations\n",
    "- ICA decomposition further increases the signal-to-noise ratio of brain component process measures relative to scalp channel measures\n",
    "- ICA project to the scalp in a dipolar spatial pattern compatible with the projection of field activity from a single cortical location\n",
    "    - The best-fitting tiny battery position and orientation together define the equivalent dipole as an approximate source location\n",
    "    - The spatial locations of both the equivalent dipoles, the actual source locations for independent component processes with dipolar projections can be estimated using an electrical head model, optimally one built from an individual participant magnetic resonance head image though a best-fit standard template head model provides a small margin of localization error\n",

    "    - the ongoing EEG channel signals may be processed using spectral analysis, across a time period of interest, to identify the mean or relative power measures for one or more EEG frequency bands of interest (qEEG)\n",
