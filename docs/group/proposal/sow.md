Team Gold Lemur, 2017

| Sprint   | Date Due | Requirements: Portion of manuscript (and package) corresponding to... |
|---|---|---|
| Sprint 0: Scope & Plan | 9/26 | <ul><li>Background reading</li>  <li>Proposal slides</li>  <li>Statement of work</li> <li>Bibliography</li></ul> |
| Sprint 1: Top 10s | 11/1 | <ul><li>Scope problems from literature that this tool can solve</li><li>Graphing library to produce top n > 10 plots for each modality (some are one-to-one, some are many-to-one aggregate)</li><li>Notebook to produce all plots for a single subject, and aggregate plots for entire HBNB</li><li>choose a plotting library and design a uniform aesthetic for all plots</li></ul>  |
| Sprint 2: Refine and Deploy Top 10s | 12/15  | <ul><li>Refine top plots to get n=10 for each modality (some one-to-one, some many-to-one)</li><li>Docker pipeline to generate all plots</li><li>MVP webservice</li><li>cloud based deployment</li><li>Run and save views for whole HBNB dataset</li></ul>  |
| Sprint 3: Cross-modal visualizations | 2/15   | <ul><li>Visualizations derived from >1 modality</li><li>Test dependence/independence of signals from different modalities</li><li>Basic demonstrations of 'looking at' biomarkers cited in current research</li></ul> |
| Sprint 4: Wrap up webservice & analysis | 4/1 | <ul><li>Add Sprint 3 work into webservice deployment, make 'production ready'</li><li>get as many datasets as possible to work with tool</li><li>Generalize plotting if useful for other teams in the class (may be done by making an AVATR plug-in, or our own generalized services)</li></ul> |
