### Meeting 11/7/2017

- Yuka
  - **Sprint 1:**
    - Literature scoping
    - Basic plotting
    - Tried working with Docker for fMRI whole brain connectivity
  - Lots of things to do in a task, do not know how to do any of them
    - Eg the CPAC stuff
  - Many of sprint 2 goals, don't know what they are, would like to explore regardless
  - **Wants to learn how to work with the different CS tools over the algorithms**
    - Work on the cloudy part    
- Vidur
  - **Sprint 1**
    - Jumped person to person, learned a lot with different people
    - Wasn't clear on what it was for
- Ronak
  - **Wants signal processing and implementation experience**
  
  
### Sprint 2 Goals
  - Dockerization + Deployment:
    - Yuka + Ryan/Nitin tap in/out
  - Quantify Distance Metrics
    - Nitin
      - Run on multiple metrics at once
      - Metric of metrics: discriminability, 2-sample
  - New Distance Metrics + See How They Apply to Dataset
    - Ronank: Explore distance metrics, focus on SP metrics (fMRI and EEG)
    - Ryan: Explore phenotypic metrics
    - Vidur: Implement those metrics and see the efficacy, if he finds issues
  - Miscellaneous
    - Add last 1-to-1's to lemur based on relationships we find - Ryan
