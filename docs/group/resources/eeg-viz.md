**EEG Visualizations, incorporating spatial metadata with temporal data:**

- Sparklines
  - Raw sparklines
    - Highlight specific *bad* ones (not really necessary becasue of preprocessing)
  - Average over sets of electrodes
    - Decided by location metadata
    - Decided by location metadata and correlation of electrode activity
  - Separate by event triggers, place side by side
  - Separate by spikes not associated with events?
  - Separate by frequency bands
- Spectrograms
  - Raw spectrogram
  - Separate by frequency bands
    - Draw lines separating within the full spectrogram to make comparison easier
    - Specific zoom ins of each band
- Correlation Matrix
