# How to upload pictures to github
If you make a markdown file (like this) there is no easy way to add images to it.
(You would need to upload pictures to your repo and link to them like you would in a normal static webpage).

There is an easier way!
1. Create a new issue / edit an existing issue (it would be good to keep one `Pictures` issue).
2. Drag images from your computer into the text box on the issue.
3. Save the issue. The pictures should now be shown in the rendered issue.
4. Right click each picture and copy the link location (or copy link address).
5. Type `![]()` in the markdown where you want the picture to render.
6. Paste the link location in the parenthesis (see the raw of this .md to see).
7. Done! Preview to check it out.
