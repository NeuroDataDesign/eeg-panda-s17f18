#### How to download data from the HBNB (Healthy Brain Network Biobank).

# Phenotypic data
* Some small publicilly available phenotypic data here: http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/_files/HBN_S1_Pheno_data.csv
~Follow instructions under LORIS here: http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/sharing_phenotypic.html#loris
You can try the COINS Data Catalog too, but the HBN data did not seem to be listed there for some reason.~
