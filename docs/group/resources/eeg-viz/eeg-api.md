- Function
    - Input:
        - Event array
        - Timeseries
        - Window around timestamp of event

        - Time series split up according to events

## Spectrogram Plots

- Raw Spectrogram
    - Input:
        - Sampling Frequency
        - Patient data per paradigm
        - Patient ID
        - Paradigm Name
        - Custom x, y bounds
            - Have a set default
        - Range of channels to present
        - Slider or subplots
            - If subplot, each subplot gets a row to itself
    - Output:
        - Title: Patient ID, paradigm, channel #
        - X axis: Frequency (Hz)
        - Y axis: Amplitude

- Event Based Frequency Comparison
    - Input:
        - Sampling Frequency
        - Patient data per paradigm
        - Patient ID
        - Paradigm Name
        - Event data (parse using function at top)
        - Custom x, y bounds
            - Have a set default
        - Range of channels to present
        - Have slider
            - By default yes, not necessary
    - Output:
        - Title: Patient ID, paradigm, channel #
        - X axis: Frequency (Hz)
        - Y axis: Amplitude
        - Slider (optional): Move through different channels
        - Subplots: look below
    - Notes:
        - Display different events by subplot

            - Have a set default
        - Downsample rate
        - Range of channels to present
        - Slider or subplots
            - If subplot, each subplot gets a row to itself
    - Output:
        - Title: Patient ID, paradigm, channel #
        - X axis: Time (decide by sampling freq and downsample rate)
        - Y axis: Amplitude

        - Custom x, y bounds
            - Have a set default
        - Downsample rate
        - Range of channels to present
        - Have slider
            - By default yes, not necessary
    - Output:
        - Title: Patient ID, paradigm, channel #
        - X axis: Frequency (Hz)
        - Y axis: Amplitude
        - Slider (optional): Move through different channels
        - Subplots: look below
    - Notes:
        - Display different events by subplot
