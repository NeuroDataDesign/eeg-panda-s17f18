    " - Most current statictical tests do not work well for data that is high dimensional, highly non-linear, and has a small sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MGC (Multiscale Generalized Correlation) takes a multi-scale resolution approach to solving this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MGC generalizes its global counterparts. E.g., if there exists a global test which will find a dependence, MGC can find that same dependence with the same number or fewer samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MGC first computes all distance pairs. Then computes all local generalized correlations between x and y distances and finds the max. Third determines whether it is significantly dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Tests an independence hypothesis\n",
    "    - null: f(x, y) = fxfy\n",
    "    - alt: f(x, y) == fxfy\n",
    "\n",
    "- open source, implemented in R and Matlab\n",

    "- Pseudocode present in the paper\n",
