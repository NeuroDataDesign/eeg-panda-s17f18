# A Resource for Assessing Information Processing in the Developing Brain Using EEG and Eye Tracking

## Summary:

- Presents a dataset combining electrophysiology and eye tracking intended as a resource for the investigation of information processing in the developing brain. 
- Many links between cognitive deficits and mental health disorders. With more and more datasets, the hope is to have a much deeper/clearer understanding of what these relationships mean. 

## How It Helps Us: 

- Paper accumulates a dataset with subjects going through myriad of cognitive assessments. 
- Could use data and create visualizations of both behavioral and biological metrics (i.e. from EEG of fmri) and use it for our own categorization. 

## In Depth: 

- We hope that this dataset will lead to the development of novel assays of neural processes fundamental to information processing, which can be used to index healthy brain development as well as detect pathologic processes.
- However, progress towards a comprehensive understanding of relationships (between cognitive deficits and mental health disorders) has remained slow. In part, this is believed to be a reflection of limitations in the current diagnostic classification systems. 
- The dataset includes high-density task-based and task-free EEG, eye tracking, and cognitive and behavioral data collected from 126 individuals (ages: 6–44). The task battery spans both the simple/complex and passive/active dimensions to cover a range of approaches prevalent in modern cognitive neuroscience.
- The participants were recruited from both the Child Mind Medical Practice, as well as the wider New York City-area community. 80.2% were typically developing, and 19.8% were diagnosed with one or more clinical disorders. The participants were 54.8% male, 45.2% female; 45.2% identified as Black or African American, 32.7% as White, 0.04% as Asian, and 17.3% as other race or races.
- Cognitive testing was administered by trained research assistants in a sound-shielded room. The participants’ responses were first-scored by the research assistant who administered the test; then, to ensure accuracy, the entire set of responses were again scored by another trained research assistant.
- High-density EEG data were recorded at a sampling rate of 500 Hz with a bandpass of 0.1 to 100 Hz, using a 128-channel EEG Geodesic Hydrocel system. The recording reference was at Cz (vertex of the head). For each participant, head circumference was measured and an appropriately sized EEG net was selected. The impedance of each electrode was checked prior to recording, to ensure good contact, and was kept below 40 kOhm. Time to prepare the EEG net was no more than 30 min. Impedance was tested every 30 min of recording and saline added if needed.
- Our task-free paradigms permit examination of intrinsic functional networks for different degrees of external stimulation, e.g., no stimulation (classical resting-state); simple and reduced (surround-suppression paradigm); and complex and rich (videos).
- Our task-based paradigms aim to isolate distinct, fundamental information processing steps that play a core role in most neuropsychological and psychometric assessments, and thereby furnish a systems-level, neurophysiologically-based account of the factors underlying observed impairments in accuracy and/or response speed.
- Naturalistic viewing paradigms, such as movies, have been shown to evoke patterns of neural activity that are synchronized across individuals, and even across species. 
- From a clinical standpoint, the use of movies in the context of functional connectivity allows shorter data collection times and decreases head movement in both adults and children. 
- EEG data was preprocessed using MATLAB and bad electrodes were identified and replaced.
