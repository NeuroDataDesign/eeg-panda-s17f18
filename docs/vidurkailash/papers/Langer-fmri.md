# The Neural Correlates of Reading Fluency Deficits in Children 

## Summary: 

- The present study aims to investigate “natural reading” at varying and individual-based reading speeds in RD (Reading Deficient) and TYP (Typical Developing Children) children in order to investigate how the pattern of activation in core reading regions changes as the opportunity to read fluently is manipulated. 
- RD compared with TYP demonstrated decreased performance in several behavioral language and reading measures.
- TYP compared with RD displayed increased activation within a variety of the reading network regions, including left FG (fusiform gyrus), superior parietal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus.


## How it Helps Us: 

- Uses fMRI to help classify differences in activation patterns between RD and TYP children 
- This could be useful for us because it shows that classification using metrics derived from fmri has been done before and proved successful. We can make our own. 
- Shows us what useful fmri data looks like. 

## In Depth: 

- Multiple studies have shown that individuals with a reading disability (RD) demonstrate deficits in posterior left-hemispheric brain regions during reading-related tasks.
- When required to read at an accelerated speed, RD children exhibited less activation in the fusiform gyrus (FG) compared with the TYP children.
- These results suggest that the FG plays a key role in fluent reading and that it can be modulated by speed. These results and their implications for remediation strategies should be considered in educational practice.
- Fifteen typically reading children (TYP; mean age = 9.9 years, SD = 1.55, age range: 8.3–12.5, 7 females) and 15 children with a diagnosed RD (mean age = 10.0 years, SD = 1.42, age range: 8.5–12.5, 6 females) participated. Groups were matched according to gender, age (P = 0.48), and nonverbal IQ
- In the MR scanner, each subject completed two 9.0-min runs of the fluency task. Each run consisted of 42 sentences. All sentences had 4 words and the number of letters was matched between conditions and runs.
- All subjects underwent 2 fMRI runs, where 271 whole-brain images were acquired with a 32-slice functional echo-planar acquisition (interleaved ascending acquisition) using a repetition time (TR) of 2000 ms, and a field of view (FOV) 192 × 192 × 153 mm (full brain coverage).
- Using an automated artifact detection software, artifactual time points were identified using a movement threshold of 2 mm and a rotation threshold of 0.02 mm and subsequent images with artifacts and voxelwise spikes were regressed out. The subjects were only included in the analysis if more than 80% of the images were artifact free.
- Whole-brain analysis was performed in 3 stages. A first-level model was conducted for each session. Data were prewhitened and regressors were modeled for the (1) speed cue: (2–4) constrained, comfortable and accelerated fluent sentence reading; (5–7) constrained, comfortable, and accelerated letter reading; (8–9) sentence and control comprehension stimuli; and (10) intertrial fixation. In addition, motion parameters were defined as confounding extraneous variables (EVs)
- Contrasts were assessed between sentence, control, and rest regressors. Statistical inference was calculated using Z statistic images, which were thresholded using a clusters determined threshold of Z = 2.3 and a corrected cluster significance threshold of P < 0.05 for the within-group contrast.
