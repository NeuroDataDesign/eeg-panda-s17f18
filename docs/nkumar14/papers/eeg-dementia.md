## EEG in Dementia and Encephalopathy

#### Extended Summary (For grading and for team)

#### Intro

- Article is about using EEG to evaluate dementia and encephalopathies

- Dementia
    - Broadly defined
    - Intellectual decline and memory dysfunction

- Dementia In EEG:
    - Resting alpha frequency declines
    - Lower limit of **normal** alpha frequency is 8 Hz
    - When comparing EEG's of cognitive decline and normal aging, there was an increase in the number of ultrashort EEG microstates
    - Cognitive decline also saw a higher amount of loss of EEG reactivity

- Encephalopathy
    - Brain state in which normal functioning is disturbed temporarily or permanently

- Encephalopathy in EEG
    - Slowing of normal background frequency
    - Reactivity to stimuli may be altered

#### Dementia

- Alzheimers (AD)
    - Increases of delta and theta frequencies
    - Decreases in alpha and beta frequency ranges
    - 10 patients with Alzheimers and 10 controls, investigated coherence across EEG nodes
        - AD had lower alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta-1 frequency band coherence
        - Occurred even with stimulus
    - Much of above conclusions need to be tested on bigger datasets as they came from different studies

- Dementia with Lewy Bodies
    - Loss of alpha activity as dominant rhythm

- Pick Disease
    - Haven't seen EEG changes with this condition

- Huntington Disease
    - Very-low-voltage EEG

- There are some additional studies quoted

#### Vascular Dementia

- Binswanger Disease
    - Slowing of background and nonspecific pattern
    - Can have periodic synchronous discharges

- Cicrulatory Encephalopathy
    - Atherosclerosis
        - Unclear correlations with EEG
    - Multi-infarct dementia
        - No specific EEG pattern

#### Encephalopathies

- Spikes and seizure detection are common across different encephalopathies
- Autoimmune encephalopathies also saw decreases in delta rhythms and lack of responses to stimuli in delta rhythms. There also was focal and/or hemispheic slowing
- There are smaller/less experiments dedicated directly to these

#### Triphasic Waveform

- Nonspecific patterns seen in some metabolic conditions, degenerative dementias, and anoxia
- High voltage, positive wave, followed by a smaller negative deflection
- NOT in children
- Slow background rhythms with TW sudden waves
- EEGs can help find and see these waves

#### Conclusion

- Multiple studies cited here, we can look into different ones
- Some conflicting opinions, but laid out patterns we can look for in our own analysis (although we're using children brains, maybe show potential for dementia/encephalopathy? We might also be able to use BRID eventually)
