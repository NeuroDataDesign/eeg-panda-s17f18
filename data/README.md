# Data
This is where you should store *all* data you are working with. All files in this directory will be ignored by `git add`, so they will not be pushed to the repo if they are placed here.

Still make sure you are not accidentally over-riding this feature, by either changing the `.gitignore` or the by using the `-f` flag in `git add`.

(This file was added using the `-f` flag)
